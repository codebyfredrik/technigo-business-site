# Project 3 - Business site

### What is this?

A business site created for a fictitious private jet charter company.

### What did I do?

This weekÂ´s project (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019) was to create a business site. I chose to create a fictitious business site for a private jet charter company called Global Aviation. The site contains a header with a name of the site, a logo, a navbar, a form and an accordion. All elements on the site are designed to be responsive to create a good experience for the user on both mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Learning objectives

- How to use image or video in the header for responsive webpages
- How to use HTML forms and simple requests
- How to modify the DOM using Javascript

### Where can you see the site in action?
