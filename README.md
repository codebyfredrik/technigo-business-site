# Project 3 - Business site (Week 3)

### 1. What is this?

A business site created for a fictitious private jet charter company.

### 2. What did I do?

This weekÂ´s project (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019) was to create a business site. I chose to create a fictitious business site for a private jet charter company called Global Aviation. The site contains a header with a name of the site, a logo, a navbar, a form and an accordion. All elements on the site are designed to be responsive to create a good experience for the user on both mobile, tablet and desktop.

### 3. Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### 4. Learning objectives

- How to use image or video in the header for responsive webpages
- How to use HTML forms and simple requests
- How to modify the DOM using Javascript

### 5. Where can you see it in action?
